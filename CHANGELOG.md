# Changelog

## Unreleased

## lite-v0.1.1

### Fixed

- fixed query-log exact client-IP search so entering plain IPv4 values such as `10.0.0.10` now matches logs stored as IPv4-mapped IPv6 like `::ffff:10.0.0.10`
- fixed query-log client-IP filtering to normalize stored and requested client addresses before comparison
- fixed client alias search so both fuzzy and exact alias lookups now resolve to matching client IPs before querying logs
- fixed multi-client alias matches so one alias keyword can return logs for every matching client instead of only a single exact alias hit

### Tests

- added audit log regression tests for normalized client-IP equality and multi-client alias-backed filtering in `coremain/audit_test.go`

### Upgrade Notes

- this release does **not** require a YAML config change
- existing deployments can update only the binary

## v0.3.21

### Fixed

- fixed `domain_mapper` overlap handling so `full:` / `domain:` hits now keep merging matching `keyword:` and `regexp:` rules instead of stopping at the first domain-style result
- restored config-order-consistent routing behavior for overlapping domain sets such as white/black/grey lists, dedicated upstream domains, redirects, ddns domains, and client/domain policy combinations

### Upgrade Notes

- this release does **not** require a YAML config change
- existing deployments can update only the binary
- if a domain was already learned into generated direct/proxy cache files, clear the stale generated lists once after upgrade so new matches can be rebuilt under the fixed logic

## v0.3.20

### Changed

- refined the maintained Vue UI overview header spacing so the total-query and average-latency values keep a stable gap as query counts grow
- standardized secondary-menu and ordinary-button hover behavior to use color-only feedback without vertical movement
- kept clickable UI controls on the normal cursor style for a consistent operator experience across desktop browsers
- updated the WebUI frontend build to stamp cache-busting asset query versions in both the embedded app HTML and root `/` HTML entry

### Fixed

- fixed the local-rules editor scrollbar visual edge so the thumb no longer breaks the editor's top-right rounded corner when scrolled to the top
- improved the local-rules editor note/status area with a compact glass-style hint chip while keeping the editor itself as the primary rounded input surface

### Upgrade Notes

- this release does **not** require a YAML config change
- existing deployments can update only the binary
- if the browser keeps old UI assets, refresh once to load the new embedded frontend asset version

## v0.3.12

### Added

- added legacy-style quick actions in the Vue query-log detail modal:
  - `客户端` / `域名` / `分流规则` / `Trace ID` now provide inline `复制` and `筛选` buttons
  - quick filter reuses the live-query search box so operators can jump straight from a detail view to narrowed logs

### Changed

- refined audit effective-tag display so the UI emphasizes the final routing result more accurately:
  - first-hit direct candidates that finally enter `sequence_fakeip_addlist` now show `生效标签=直连候选转代理`
  - learned-memory reversals are labeled explicitly as `记忆直连转代理` / `记忆代理转直连`
  - stable learned-proxy results continue to show `记忆代理`

### Upgrade Notes

- this release does **not** require manual `config_up.zip` updates
- no YAML config migration is required for existing deployments

## v0.3.11

### Changed

- fixed dark-theme readability regressions in custom-background/panel-background mode:
  - restored visible text color for `专属分流组` name chips
  - fixed contrast for `msg.success` / `result-badge.fail` / requery status chips under glass background
- fixed mobile overlap risk in data-management `刷新分流缓存` module:
  - removed rigid fill-height constraints in inline modules
  - made requery status/actions/scheduler rows wrap safely on narrow screens
- bumped embedded Vue asset query version in `log.html` to force cache refresh for updated CSS

### Upgrade Notes

- this release does **not** require manual `config_up.zip` updates
- if client-side cache is stale, refresh once to load `v20260427-v052` frontend assets

## v0.3.10

### Added

- added panel-background solid-color picker support directly in the `面板背景` row:
  - the picker is now inline (left of `上传`) instead of a separate control block
  - solid-color background can be applied with the same appearance workflow as image backgrounds
- added theme-isolated panel solid-color storage:
  - `明亮` and `黑暗` now keep independent panel solid-color values
  - backend appearance payload now carries `light_color` and `dark_color` while keeping legacy `color` compatibility

### Changed

- refactored top-level and second-level page chrome to reduce redundant stacked panels:
  - removed extra top title-wrapper panels for overview/data/upstream/system pages
  - query/rules subnavigation now uses a clean strip + divider layout
- refined list/data/system module structure to reduce duplicate background layers and tighten action alignment
- updated appearance handling:

- updated requery URL action calls to normalize local loopback targets to the configured WebUI port instead of fixed `9099`
- improved requery diagnostics in UI:
  - added `last_error` in task status
  - data-management panel now shows latest failure reason
  - sub-second completion now renders as `耗时 <1秒`
- refined menu/switch theme behavior:

### Changed

- improved second-level tab selected-state visibility by adding a clearer selected border for:
  - `实时查询 / 诊断抓取`
  - `本地规则 / 订阅规则 / 拦截规则`
- upgraded appearance reset behavior to reset the whole theme/appearance stack with confirmation:
  - theme -> `明亮`
  - panel background -> cleared
  - transparency -> `100%`
  - blur -> `0px`
  - text color -> default
- removed remaining hardcoded green text/button text colors in multiple UI surfaces so text color follows the active theme text color more consistently
