# Handover

## Current state

As of `2026-05-06`, the fork is in a stable maintained state with these major outcomes already landed:

- Vue UI is the default UI at `/`
- legacy UI is retained at `/log`
- dedicated routing groups (`special_groups`) are implemented and actively used
- upstream group binding is implemented in the WebUI workflow
- subscription-rule save flow supports backend download behavior
- major dashboard pages were migrated to the Vue workflow
- the maintained `/` UI includes mutually exclusive `IPv4优先` / `IPV6屏蔽` controls with corresponding runtime flow support
- the maintained `/` UI includes persisted appearance controls such as panel background, text color, and button color
- recent overview-card and mobile compatibility fixes have been validated on real deployment hosts

## Important active realities

- this repository is the maintained `lite` workspace at `/Users/tom/Documents/github/mosdns-lite`
- the corresponding `main` workspace lives at `/Users/tom/Documents/github/mosdns`
- when already working inside this folder, treat the target line as `lite` unless the user explicitly redirects the task elsewhere
- the main ongoing UI target is `/`
- the legacy UI is kept mainly as fallback, comparison target, and compatibility reference

## Things already decided

- do not follow upstream `nft`-related work for this fork
- do not re-review upstream changes on or before `2026-04-18` unless the user asks
- keep the main UI behavior close to the legacy UI first, then improve selectively
- manual lists and URL-based lists both bind to a specific upstream group in the custom workflow
- the newer custom routing path should not use global cache for now

## Known pitfalls

### 1. Directory name vs route mismatch

`webui-log/` is the main Vue workspace, even though `/log` is now the legacy UI route.

### 2. Naming mismatch

Use `special_groups`, not `route_group`.

### 3. Public docs vs operator notes

This repository can store process notes, but not secrets. Keep passwords and private tokens out of committed files.

Current non-secret deployment notes that are safe to keep in repo docs:

- test host: `10.0.0.91` (`mos-test`)
- production host: `10.0.0.3` (`mosdns`)
- related debug hosts:
  - `10.0.0.2` (`sing-box`)
  - `10.0.0.6` (`network-vm`)
- runtime config root on deployed hosts: `/cus/mosdns`
- on this machine, prefer the matching aliases from `~/.ssh/config` when available

### 4. Frontend build order for embedded assets

If a release binary should carry updated Vue assets, build order matters:

- run the `webui-log/` production build first
- then run `go build`

Running them in parallel can produce a binary with mismatched embedded `app.js` / `app.css`.

Typical validation flow remains:

- local build
- test host first
- production host only after confirmation

### 5. Mobile overview-table compatibility

The `/` overview page has real mobile/browser compatibility sensitivity.

Confirmed pitfalls include:

- `table-layout: fixed` plus `calc(...)` widths on narrow metric tables
- broad `overflow-wrap: anywhere` rules interacting with fixed or semi-fixed mobile columns

Visible failure modes included:

- `最慢查询` domains collapsing into character-by-character wrapping
- some mobile browsers collapsing the left domain column almost completely while still showing the `耗时` column

When this kind of issue reproduces only on some phones, treat it as a CSS/browser compatibility bug first.

## Pending / plausible next work

### Selective Type65 rewriting

The user asked whether the fork can support:

- removing `ipv4hint`
- removing `ipv6hint`
- removing `ECH` while keeping `Type65`

Current conclusion:

- not implemented yet
- feasible
- best implemented as a new response-rewrite plugin over `HTTPS` / `SVCB` answers

### Future UI or config improvements

Most future work is likely to continue in one of these directions:

- refine the maintained Vue UI
- add more explicit routing diagnostics
- add backend plugins that match existing config/UI concepts instead of ad-hoc toggles

## Fast-start advice for a successor agent

If the user opens a fresh task, do this first:

1. Read `AGENTS.md`
2. Read `docs/ai/project-context.md`
3. Read `docs/ai/config-notes.md`
4. Read `docs/ai/handover.md`
5. Confirm actual route mapping in `coremain/www/` before editing frontend behavior
6. Confirm whether the task targets the maintained `/` UI or the legacy `/log` compatibility route
